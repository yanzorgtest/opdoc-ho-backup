# Retiring your MTPS content (migration from MTPS to Open Publishing) #

If you are migrating your content from MTPS (published with PWS or the Build Sytem) to Open Publishing, you will need to retire your old content, so it does not appear in the search engines. 

As part of the retirement operation, make sure that you set your content to NoIndex and NoFollow and promote the content again. Once this is done, the old content will be removed from the site map in the next refresh (once every sprint) or VSC will do as an Out of Band. Remember to do this for all your locales.

If your content is not removed from the site maps and still appear in the search results, open a bug via the [MSDNHelp portal](http://msdnhelp/) with the content ids, the locales, and when you retired your content. Provide the CMS you are using as well as the publishing list if you know.

# Redirection #
Right now, MTPS does not provide automatic redirection. So we will work with you on getting your content redirected if we can. We will try to offer two ways:

1. Topic to topic redirection.
2. Grouped redirection.


# Retiring with a target URL
You might decide to retire your content by adding a URL in your MTPS content that points to the Open Publishing content. If that is the case, this is something you will need to do for now manually according to your current content management system. Moving forward, VSC will provide an easier way to do this task.
