In order to make partners feel comfortable with moving to Open Publishing, we recommend partners to perform a visual inspection of the content. Here is some items to look for. If you are moving content from another system (CAPS, OA, etc.), please note that the content might not render exactly the same. So use your legacy content for reference, although do not expect a 1-to-1 mapping.

We recommend you find different pages with different content types, so you have a good breadth of content to look at. 

Additionally, you should look at the content in different screen resolutions, as OP uses the responsive library and content renders differently.

Here are some areas:

* TOC is complete and working as expected: it expands and collapses, and links are working.
* Content URLs â€“ If you are moving from OA and you are leveraging the URLs, make sure that they are indeed the same while you are testing. 
* Images appear as expected
* Links render properly and work as expected
* Formatting of the topics is as expected
* Lists and tables look good
* Code samples render fine
